This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies - I recommend to use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) instead of NPM as it has better performance and module resolution.
If you don't have it, get take a look into its [installation page](https://pnpm.io/installation) (its simple)

```
pnpm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
